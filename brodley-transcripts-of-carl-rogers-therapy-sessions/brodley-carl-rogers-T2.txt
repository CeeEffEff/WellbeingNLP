[T] Hi.
[C] Hi Carl. 
[T] Good to see ya.
[C] I’ve been looking forward to this moment.
[T] Well, I’m eager to know what’s what with you.
[C] Well, do you mean in terms of thepast year or right now?
[T] Oh, right now, whatever your concerns are in your present life.  Iguess that’s what I’m interested in.
[C] Well, um,  I come here with an agenda,  like, of a particular thingI’d like to discuss with you.  And, and I think that discussing it will behelpful in terms of my, of my life.
[T] Uh-huh. Then that’s what I’d like you to discuss.
[C] Well, I think I’m doing very well in many ways, and I need to do some work, too.  And, uh, the most pressing thing with me is that I planto go to work in the fall,  full-time,  and have the care of bothof my sons.  Without any support other than what I’m earning.  And I, and I, I don’t feel very upset about it, but I believe that deep down inmy body I’m really afraid. 
[T] Are you afraid of the responsibility or, or what aspect of it is most frightening?
[C] Well what, what seems most frightening as I think about it is coming home fromwork very tired  and having, um, two little boys that need a lot. 
[T] Will you really be able to be a mother to them when they, when you come home from work. Hmmm?
[C] Well, I’m sure I can do it  because I, it’s done every day. And, uh, thewomen I know an… who are trying to do that are having a really hard time.  And I’ve been thinking about talking about this problemnow with you. I haven’t really… I, I talk about in a heady way with my friends,and, uh, I haven’t given myself any real support  with it. It’s a real fear I
[T]  And you haven’t really had a chance to explore it in, indepth; you’ve talked about it more on a, on the surface level.
[C] Well, the exploring I’ve done is…  I decided for myself- wellsimple, I’ll look for other single working mothers  with young childrenwho are doing well.  And I’ll talk to them and see what they do. So I started asking, asking my friends, asking some people I know, “Do youknow of this kind of person?” Well after about a month,  I didn’t comeup with one,  one single woman taking care of young children andworking full-time who was doing very well  and that scared me.
[T] So the track record, the track record that the other people have, the other womenhave makes you really concerned about will you be able to do it?
[C] Well that substantiates my concern.
[T] Yeah. Yeah.
[C] I’ve had the concern.    I wish, I keep wishing I could find some secrets to make it easier for myself. Andthe only secrets I can come up with are working half-time  and beingreally, like, no…  just barely, you know, paying rent and food and so forth and so on.  But, I do know how to do that  andthat may be what I decide to do.
[T] It’s one possible option at any rate. Mhm.
[C] But it seems like a real limited lifestyle.
[T] It is clear to me from the, from the tears that came up the first that, that, uh, this issomething you feel a lot of concern about, isn’t it?
[C] Oh, I feel I’m two things . All alone  and somewhat doomed tofail.
[T] Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.
[C] And, uh,  doomed to fail, not that I will die or  anything. Ithink doomed to fail and to be there for my children  in apositive, cheerful,  warm, loving way.  And being asingle parent, like I will be  their support system to a large extent.  And it scares me to think of their main support as being exhausted  and irritated  and  … 
[T] You just feel, “I may not be able to make it. I may be doomed  to failure by the very circumstances.”
[C] Right.    And talking about it this way I feeltwo ways: Like, “Oh c’mon Sylvia. Everybody else is doing it too.” And on theother hand, like, you’re willing to sit here and talk  about it with me  and I appreciate that. 
[T] Mhm. Mhm. But you don’t have to just tell yourself, “Oh, buck up, you can do it.”It’s, it gives you a good chance to really…
[C]  Right. Well, I do do that, “Buck up, you can doit.” I’ll do that plenty. But I don’t get much opportunity to,  to be sadwith somebody about it.  How hard it  seems. 
[T] Yeah. Yeah. That’s the thing isn’t it? That to be all alone, with no support fromanybody, it sounds like…
[C] Well, I mean  there are people that  careabout me.  There’s, like, no financial  support. And it’s not like I’ll have my mother next door,  or something like that.
[T] You’ll be alone with a heavy burden and it is a sad prospect really.
[C]   It feels sad.  And I get…when I,  I depress myself by thinking, “Well, oh, sure I can give up mychildren.” And I think, “Well, I won’t do that.” Um, I’m seeing it as a black orwhite thing  and I know that’s not reality.
[T]  But it feels like reality. That either you’d have to give up your children or,or else  make a go of it.
[C] But then I also feel suspicious of myself. Like, “Well, Sylvia, you’re used to somuch of getting your needs met.” Like, going out at night sometimes, um, having friends,  and, and having a social life and not being overtired. And then I see myself as pampered.  And, uh, if Ijust wasn’t so pampered,  things would be a lot better.
[T] That’s when you kind of scold yourself,  really. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. So that you really feel you’re gonna be hemmed in by that. Imean, your life is gonna be constricted  a good deal. A lot of the thingsyou’ve been used to you just won’t have.
[C] And want for myself.
[T] And want for yourself.  Uh-huh.
[C] Yeah, that’s right.
[T] So really it does look like a very tough period, doesn’t it?
[C] Yep. It does.  But, I like being able to be sad and complain abouthow terrible I’m afraid it’s going to be then I can… like now I’m feeling like, andI’m excited too, you know, about facing it.
[T] Sort of a new phase of your life? Is it… it has excitement as well as dread in it, Iguess.
[C]  Yeah about seeing what it will be like,  in fact. .
[T] It will be a new adventure but it’s one that, uh, you feel different ways about.
[C] Mhm. Yeah. So that’s, that’s what I think about the most, in terms of a problemarea.  Like, the  way I started crying it seemed like I justcouldn’t wait to get here and cry about it.  It was a littledramatic that way.
[T] ‘Cos it is…well, it is, it is a real sad prospect. And one, I guess, that you don’t letout too much to other people, the sad side of it.
[C] Right, I don’t do that  very well. I,  I am busy being strong unconsciously. Or I’m also busy being depressed.   I’ve learned well. I believe being sad and scared are more dealing with  the problem.
[T] Mhm. Yeah being, being frightened of what you’re taking on and sad of whatyou’re losing for yourself.  Those are two very real  feelings.
[C] And I,  I also think that part of my fear and excitement is that I’ll be doingsomething different. Like, I’ve never worked  in, in my profession  and been like a confident,  single woman with youngchildren  who are doing well.  And it’s like, um, that’s what Iwant for myself.  
[T] It’s a goal you’ve been working toward.  Mhm.  Iwonder sort of how do your children feel about this?
[C] Well, my youngest son wants me to go work  so that we can have more money and so that he can have more spending money. And, uh, my oldest son has not, at this time, agreed to live with me yet.  But I’mpreparing  with the hopes that he will at that time.  He isliving with… he will be living with me the rest of the summer.
[T] Mhm. So that’s another new part of the…
[C] And my oldest son and I have a very strained relationship. He hasn’t been livingwith me the last two years. And so that’s gonna be another difficult part of whatI’m talking about  is, um, at the same time needing and wanting toimprove my relationship with Senate  and hoping there’ll be money forcounseling. I’m hoping  that we can do work with a third party or in  a, uh, family group of some sort  because I believe that we’llneed help.  And, uh, so that’s, that, that part of the fall or the comingyear scares me too about feeling so alienated from Senate.
[T] “Will he, will he really accept me as a mother?”
[C]  As his mother,  as someone who loves him  andcares about him.
[T] So that’s a concern to ya, too.
[C]   Mhm. And can we get along? Can we live together? We haven’t lived together, and he’s lived in a very different lifestyle.
[T] “Can we really form a relationship of the kind that both of us would like?”
[C] Pardon?
[T] Your asking yourself, “Can we really form a relationship that both of us will like?”
[C]  Mhm. Yeah, and be happy and,  yeah…  That’s an important… I hadn’t thought of that on my own, but youmentioning my children  brings up the part about Senate, which is avery important part of what I think about.  And I’m happy I’ll have himwith us  during the summer and we’ll be able to have time.
[T] You can get a start on that. Mhm.
[C] Mhm. Yeah.  When I’m not working,  for example. Well, I felt awfully rigid about this upcoming filming.  I felt it in my body a lot. And I feel, I felt more relaxed since we started.
[T] Mhm. Mhm.  It’s a really difficult thing.
[C] Mhm.  Right, and just the same it’s exciting  to come  on this trip and to see you again  and it’s also frightening a lot. Ya know, who’s gonna see it? And what are they gonna think?  And what’s it gonna look like?  Am I, am I being hard onmyself or am I being good to myself? I don’t know - to put myself in this position is what I mean.
[T] Yeah.  You have quite a little of conflict about, “Should I really be doingthis? Who, who will see it?  What will they say? Am I wise?”
[C] Uh-huh. What’s it gonna be? What’s the finished project, gonna be?  Will I ever see it?   
[T]  Looks to me as though your eyes are saying something, but Idon’t know what. 
[C] Well, I’m thinking about how moved I’ve been when I’ve heard your voice a fewtimes over the past year.  And now I’m here.
[T] That made a…
[C] I wanna take it in –  being here.
[T] Mhm.  I guess you’re saying that I mean a good deal to you.
[C] Well, this time with you.  Yes, you, mhm.   I’mthinking about what I want to talk about or I’m feeling kind of empty right nowabout talking. 
[T] Can you tell me what I do mean to you?
[C]  Yes, I can.  Well,  I think the bestthing that I like to think about you is that as I understand your writings, I have notread very much that you’ve written, but that you have, that you live what you writeabout. And my understanding of a lot of popular writers are they write one thingand somehow they just don’t quite live that. They live something very different.And so I think of you as,  um,  wonderful in that way and not,uh… 
[T] But what does that mean to you?
[C]   Well that it’s what I would like to be more:  to have values and be able to, to do them  and to live them.
[T]  You’d like to have a good match between your life and what you believe  and value.
[C]  And what I also sense about you is, uh, like “patience” isn’t the right word, but I see you as being comfortable with yourself so much so thatwhatever I or anyone else says or does, doesn’t  get you uptight.
[T] 
[C]  And maybe it does.  Sometimes it probably does ‘cause you’re a human being.
[T] It certainly does, that’s right.
[C] But it doesn’t seem like it does  too much. And I like that. I would like to be more present  and, and comfortablewith myself so that other people, including my children and so forth and so on,could do what they do, and that I could be able to be a source of support and not bepersonally threatened  by this little thing and that littlething.
[T] And that, that has meaning to me. You’d like to be sufficiently accepting ofyourself, that then you can be comfortable with what your children do or whatother people do  and not, uh,  not feel frightened, thrown off balance.
[C]  Mhm. And I’ve enjoyed through the year in the few letters that I’ve gottenfrom you, your warmth, and interest in me, in my life. I’ve liked that a lot from you. And at the time those letters were written we had no plans to  make a movie  or all that stuff so that was really enjoyable.  Do you feel answered well?
[T] Yeah. Mhm. Mhm.  And I’m interested enough in you toknow of any other things in your life that are important to you or that, uh, that aredifficult for ya, or whatever.
[C]  Well, I’d like to go one of two ways. I don’t know which yet.Uh, one way would be back to the single working mother business. I’m not surewhere we might go with that, but I know it’s a big thing for me. And another waywould be to go with the difficulty I see myself in having with my relationshipswith men.   I do so much analyzing that I, I feel like throwing up my hands. “What’s the use of even talking about it?”But I…
[T] But you do have  difficulties in…
[C] Yeah. I’ll, I’ll go with the men.  And that’s the most frightening thingfor me to talk about  on this film because people that I know willprobably be seeing this  and men that I know.  I seemyself, uh, and this, this is real scattered in my mind.  Scattered, and looking every which way.  Well, I see myself making acquaintancewith men, many men, I mean not just one man  and spending some timewith that person. And then, um, feeling that they lost interest in me or that I turnedthem off. And I tell myself things like, “You can’t expect every man you meet tofall in love with you.”  And, um, let’s see,  what else?  Oh and then I’ll tell myself all these reasonable… “Of coursethis man doesn’t like me because I’m this and I’m that and.…” But, I don’t veryoften feel the disappointment and confusion about “Well I had a good time withthat man.” And it seems to me like he must not have had a good time with mebecause I didn’t hear from him again, or I did and things went such and such away. And, uh…
[T] Sounds like it seems kind of mysterious to you.  Why the men loseinterest in you.
[C] Uh-huh. And then I have feedback from one person, one man friend of mine, whosays that I create, ya know I turn people off, men, myself. And so it’s like it’s all,it’s all my doing anyway.  But I have felt lately impotent about how to, how to have a successful long rel- long lasting relationship witha man. Successful, I don’t mean perfect, I mean  workable.  And, uh, I think workable is successful  these days. Yeah.
[T] Well, that’s a part of your life in which you just haven’t had the kind of, um,success that you wish you had had. Mhm. Mhm. An important lack in some way.
[C]  Now I’m remembering we talked about this before.
[T] A little bit.
[C] A little bit, right.   And I do that, the kind of analyzingthat ‘”Well I have all these habits like, uh, I, um, I like to be by myself, I’m notreal generous and outgoing  and taking care of, of people that I meet.”And the woman that I live with says that she doesn’t see me doing that at all like,“Oh come in I’ll fix you dinner, I’ll do this, I’ll do that.” Like I don’t do that.  And, and so I’m confused about do I need to do that to be in a closerelationship? It doesn’t seem to me like I should  need to sell out to beum enjoyed and wanted.
[T] I gather what you mean by “selling out” is that if you, if you really put yourself outin kind of an artificial way, you don’t want that. Is that what you’re saying?
[C] Yes, if I do all these things for a man, so then he’ll want me.
[T] Mhm. Kind of buying his favor,  as it were. And you just don’tsee yourself doing that. Don’t wanna do that.
[C] Or wanting to do it.   And then I… another question,hard question, I ask myself is, “Well, I’m choosing men to relate to that don’t knowhow to give in the way that I want to be given to.”  And then I try to figure that one out.  “Oh simple, I’m choosing, that justmeans I need to choose differently.”  And then I look around and itdoesn’t seem so simple.
[T] Mhm. You say you’re trying to analyze and analyze and analyze what, “what lackin me?” or “you know what lack in me?’ I guess your asking yourself mostly,“What lack in me keeps,  keeps me from having a lasting relationship with men?”
[C] And one thing that now I’m recalling that really frightened me was I was talking- Ilived with my husband for eight years  and I felt rejected by him and Ileft him.  And I left him for a man I was very much in love with thatI’ve been very close to  for five years. But he’s also… like, I movedaway from him but I felt left  by him also. And so this man friend of minesaid to me, “Well, what’s wrong with you that you can’t keep a man?” And that,uh, that really scared me inside because when I look at the situation in a practical,sensible way that doesn’t seem like reality.  But then I don’t knowmaybe it’s true.
[T] But that her saying that  he saying that,  uh, really does touchsomething in you. “Is there something wrong with me  that I….“
[C] That I don’t see.  And, and, uh, just the fact that it touched me so muchshows me that there’s something there.
[T] Mhm. It,  it wouldn’t bother you that much, or you wouldn’t think somuch about it if there wasn’t something in you that that refers to.
[C] Mhm.  And I,  I see my mother that way a lot, that my mother notbeing able to have a successful relationship with a man and so that’s been mymodel and…  like, why can’t…
[T] You’re saying, “Maybe, maybe I’m just following the same pattern as my mother.”
[C] Mhm. Well, I am in that respect and I don’t like it.  And I’m not willingto do a bunch of crummy stuff that I…   So, right now I’m living alone  and I’m not doing any crummy stuff.  And I also have some very nice relationships. It’s  those shades ofblack and white.  But I do feel a lot of confusion about buildingan intimate relationship.  A monogamous type  orprimary…
[T] So you can have good times and all that, but still there is this nagging question orthese nagging questions, “Am I just following my mother’s pattern?” “What is wrong with me that I don’t have a permanent relationship with a man?”
