[C] 
[T] Well, where would you like to start this morning? 
[C] Well, uh, I want to tell you about something that I've been thinking about and that’s it's a, a sharing more than  telling you a problem.  And that is I’ve just recently noticed in myself that I've been learning.   And that's a big deal. Uh, I hear people say all the time, “Oh, I've learned so much, I learned this and I learned that and that was such a learning experience.” And I, all these years that I've been grown up, I haven't felt any learning, and I feel, “Well, what did you learn and how did you know that you learned it?” And it was a mystery to me.  And just the last few weeks, or actually I've been realizing in the last year mainly is that I’ve learned some things  and I know I've learned them and I, I know that, okay, that I'm at this point and with a certain situation or idea and that six months ago or three months ago it was different.  And so I'm feeling my learning and that's really exciting. 
[T] And it’s the awareness of it that's new.  That you're beginning to realize, “Hey, I am different in this respect,  I've learned something.” 
[C] I've changed.  And I can see the difference and feel the difference.  Yeah. 
[T] What are some of those differences? 
[C] Well,  um, I, I've made a decision to be more strict with my children  and to, uh, to listen to them but decide that I'm their mother and I know many things they don't, and that I will make many more decisions than  I've made in the past. And uh- 
[T] M-hm, m-hm. Sounds as though you feel a bit stronger that way. 
[C] Yes. And and I've been trying it.  Trying being the more strict person and it's working beautifully.  Uh, they at first they, you know, have their little resistance or whatever it is but then we go on with the program, which is my program more,  and I feel a lot better about that as being uh uh helping children to adjust to the world. 
[T] I mean, sounds, sounds like you feel more like a grown-up mother. 
[C] M-hm. Capable.  Of making appropriate decisions.  For them. And another area is sex. And, uh, and I, I've done a lot of things in the past year, in the past mainly year that I haven't done before. That is, I've had intercourse with a few different men  and put myself in situations where before I was absolutely unwilling to do because of my fears and, and I've learned some things about myself. Like I know a lot more right now today about what kind of sexual relationship, what kind of intimate relationships that I want to have with men and that feels good.  Beca ... and, um, and it only came through, uh, risking I mean there was no, it only became through trying things out, there was no amount  There was no amount of, of therapy or reading or thinking or talking  that helped me to learn those things,  but it was feeling strong enough within myself that I can take chances. 
[T] So risking has been the road to learning  in the sexual area. 
[C] Uh-huh.  And it is with my children  and it is with relating to people in many ways, not just sexually.   Other ways too. Reaching out to people and approaching strangers and, uh ... 
[T] Taking all kinds of risks that you hadn't before. 
[C] Some. More,  which, I mean I, I don't know about all kinds.  Quite a few, and it's been exciting  and hard. 
[T] And I guess that leads to a, uh, to a deeper kind of learning, or at any rate, a learning that you feel more sure of. I guess, I get a sense of assurance in what you're talking about. An assurance in you. 
[C] Well, yes. Yes and no.  And I ... I ... feel more im... like I, I was saying before, I feel more immature and more and I'm more aware of my immaturity.  They're both, uh, a part of each other.  And uh, does that make, does that, I guess I'm thinking that it just sounds crazy. 
[T] No, I don't 
[C] To say that I feel more mature because I know I'm how, I know more about how immature I am. 
[T] Uh-huh. No, that makes a lot of sense to me. 
[C] It does. 
[T] Uh-huh. Because you’re, you're uh more aware of all aspects of yourself  and it sounds a more acceptant of them too. “Yes, I'm mature in certain ways  and here's some ways I know I'm immature.” 
[C] And I didn't know that before,  or I, I knew I felt uncomfortable that I didn't understand it.  But that's related to something I've been thinking about, I think, about being here with you and, uh, and telling myself two things.  One is, “Oh, you're just a, I'm just a dependent personality,” you know, Carl Rogers or blah-blah-blah-blah, don't, I don't run my own life.  I go for help a lot.  And then I tell myself I’ve always been so strong and so together and having everything so worked out in my head that I don't allow myself to, to be helpless in a situation where it might be  good for me.  Like right now here with you, I would like to be more helpless, which to me means open, I think.  To what to us and, uh, and I see myself being, uh, together and not being helpless.  
[T] Sounds as though you, you voice that as a conflict, but it sounds as though really you're more on the, on the side of the second aspect that, uh, uh, to be open and, and in that sense helpless and vulnerable, I guess might be a possible term too, um, is something you, you really believe that's what you are, rather than that you're a totally dependent person and really helpless and have to, have to run for help. I sort of get the feeling you like this aspect of you that is able to be with me in a way that is, uh, more open, more vulnerable perhaps. 
[C] Well, I like it and I also scold myself for being dependent,  so there's 
[T] There are the two sides, uh-huh. 
[C] there's something missing in the middle to connect,  and I it seems like you might have been talking about that and I still didn't hear it. 
[T]  M-hm.  So really to get it more accurately, you scold yourself for for being dependent, for, for wanting  to be here, for example, with me,  and yet at the same time you, you feel. uh, well, that's good, I, I really like that, but where's the, where's the integration of those two, uh, points of view.  
[C] That's right.   May I hold your hands again? 
[T] Sure. M-hm.  
[C] To feel that old feeling. 
[T] Okay. 
[C]   I would like to be less, uh, less strong right now. I would like to give myself the gift of not having to be sensible  and reasonable and  Also the protection,  protect,  protect myself. 
[T] M-hm, m-hm, m-hm. Really would be giving yourself a gift if you could just kind of let go  and not, uh, not be so  competent  and able.    
[C] And I think it helps to touch   you, to, to, to let go of the shoulds, of my  
[T] M-hm, m-hm. And you feel some contact and maybe you can say, “Well, maybe I don't have to be so strong, so  Maybe I can just let go more.” 
[C]  Yes.    I want to get away from all, um, my rationalizing right now this minute, and I don't know how to do that  except to shut up.   And,  so it's not like I have so much a desire to sit and not talk and look in your eyes as I have a desire to not be the way I am all the time.  And I don't know yet  what else to do.  
[T] Have to be kind of silent, to let go of that rational and rationalizing part of you. 
[C] M-hm.  It feels easier to focus on, uh, in this position that I'm in now with you I feel more focused,   yeah. 
[T] Are there any things that sort of come bubbling up? 
[C] Yeah, I know it's something I want to talk about.  
[T] Okay. M-hm.   But it's not easy, huh. 
[C] No, it's not easy and I'm enjoying the richness of feeling  your hands this way and letting go of some more of, of the camera business  and the ...  And, uh, and the fear about bringing up something that   and knowing that in about fifteen minutes it'll all seem, um,  I don't know not quite as serious. S21 : There's something I've been wanting to talk over with you.  
[T] Okay. 
[C] Good. I'm real attracted to black people.  And, uh, that's about the craziest part of me, um, I'm ashamed  Um, I'm embarrassed, not right now this minute, but when I'm out walking around.   And living my life. 
[T] You feel what an awful thing it is that I'm attracted to black people. 
[C] Not, and not all the black people I see  but a lot.  And, uh, like the black people that I talked it over with, it seems, it doesn't seem like any problem at all, they understand perfectly.  And, but my family, I think it's a real painful situation for them when I have as many black friends as I do.  And- 
[T] That sounds like not only your family looks down on it or something but that you scold yourself for it too. 
[C] Uh-huh, right. I, I think there's something wrong with me. 
[T] Yeah, that's it. 
[C] Um. But it doesn't- 
[T] “What kind of a crazy person am I that I feel attracted  to so many blacks?” 
[C] Sick, sick I think of it as 
[T] Sick, that's 
[C] and ne... neurotic, um.  Strange.    
[T] You really feel that there's something sick in you that causes you to have so many black friends. 
[C]  Well, I keep looking for a reasonable explanation  and there is none.  
[T] So there isn't any reason except that you feel that way. 
[C] M-hm. And I ... 
[T] And that isn't good enough. 
[C] Well, I, I, I've been struggling so long to accept that in myself and I'm still fighting. It's like I'm fighting to accept that in myself and, and letting go rather than thinking it's a terrible thing  and and that I can't let other people know.  And, uh, 
[T] You feel “I should not feel that way. I shouldn't be that way. Sick.” 
[C] Like when I, wh ... , I imagine when I meet a black person that I am attracted to, that that person will know   and I always wonder if they can tell. 
[T] Mm, see if it shows.  M-hm, m-hm. 
[C] And that they'll think I'm strange.  M-hm. And it has something to do with all the black/white sex stuff that goes on, like, um, black women and white men which is very foreign to me, I have very little thinking or, um, concern about that. But the black men/white women thing,  um. and I'm attracted to a lot of black men.  Yeah. 
[T] It has something to do with the sexual attraction. 
[C] I know, yeah, it does, I know it does.  But it's not just that, it's also  children and and women and lifestyle  and as I see it through my tunnel vision, which I do.   
[T] So I guess you're saying, um, yeah, there's a sexual element in it but I'm also attracted to their way of living. 
[C] M-hm. That I see.  And I, but I think what I see isn't what is. 
[T]  That's partly your fantasy or something.   
[C] Maybe putting that, that, this on this film will help me that  stand on the ground and be who I am.  And not be so ashamed, so embarrassed and so,  um, uncomfortable. 
[T] In a way you're saying it out loud and really in a wa ..., in a sense, publicly, may help you to feel “I don't need to be so ashamed of that.” 
[C] And I tell myself I should be joyful, I mean,   why, why negative?  And I, I guess, you know, the culture or I don't know, I   
[T] But you feel disapproved of probably, certainly by your family and maybe by the culture in this respect. 
[C] My friends don't understand.  My white friends. 
[T] M-hm, m-hm.   Makes you feel different.  Set apart or something like that.  
[C] Well, sometimes I feel different but I know a lot of other people, I believe a lot of other people feel the same way.  and I know a lot of other white women are attracted to black men. So I believe that's common. 
[T] So that somehow you know you're not alone in this. 
[C] But it seems like the strength of my feelings and, uh, the on-goingness and my de ..., my desire to identify with the black culture and,  um, is. is what seems out of proportion to me. That I feel out of proportion about it.  
[T] M-hm. So Okay, other women feel the same way but not to the degree that you do, you think.  That's kind of out of  Out of scale. 
[C] Or in general to the degree too, not just man/woman, but  people.  Maybe I,  it'll come a time accepting that part of myself. 
[T] Maybe someday you won't be ashamed of yourself for that. 
[C] M-hm. Maybe someday I can be proud of myself.  And for what I believe and feel.  And I'm gradually learning to do that. 
[T] Uh-huh, m-hm. So, perhaps what you are and what you feel will be something you can take real satisfaction in instead of feeling  how shameful. 
[C] M-hm. And to me it's it's a sign of my growth is being able to do what I'm doing with you now, you'll make a film.    It's a real brazen thing to do.  M-hm. 
[T] Feel this is a risk.  And that's a sign of learning and of growth. 
[C] M-hm. Well, also it somehow it's a little different from a risk in the sense of some of my friends say, “A film? Wh... What do you want to do that for?” I mean, there's suspiciousness about it and … 
[T] M-hm, m-hm.  So that's seen as another strange part of you. 
[C] Well, not so much, I mean, that's not a 
[T] Not so. 
[C] It doesn't bother me.   Sometimes I, well, right now  sometimes, I have the sense of talking away what we were talking about and I'm wondering, if I went away, if I withdraw from the subject, uh, what's your perspective? It seems like we were talking about my attraction to black people and now we're not. And I'm, I don't know, like did we finish talking about it or did I withdraw? S45 : Um 
[T] It's more of your analyzing it, isn't it, trying to think  about what's happening. “Did I run away from it? Or was I finished with it?”  Or continue think about it 
[C] analyze it  
[T] Instead of asking, “Do I feel as though I'm finished with it?  Do I feel as though I'm escaping from it?” 
[C] I like that. I like your your questions, or comments.  Do I feel finished?  No, I don't, I don't feel, I don't know  about escaping  and feeling finished, it's 
[T] The feeling is one of uncertainty. 
[C] M-hm.   Well I I feel like I want to go back and listen to what we just talked about,  that I didn't hear it very well.  And ... 
[T] “What did I say? What did I feel?” You'd like to have a rerun of it and it 
[C] M-hm. Like I just went jabber-jabber-jabber-jabber.  And all that.  And so- 
[T] Sounds like you scold yourself for that, as though, “Oh, I just talk talk-talk.”   It didn't sound like just talk-talk-talk to me. 
[C] It didn't? 
[T] No. 
[C]  Well, I would like to hear it again,  and it has, it,  and slowed down somehow,  and I now  I could think like taking your hand and looking at you and slowing down.  And then when I'm slowing--and that's what I want to do ...  But while I'm doing it, I'm scolding myself. “What are you doing this for?” 
[T] M-hm.  Let me give you a very brief rerun of part of it. You were saying, “I'm ashamed of myself for being attracted to black men. Uh, I know many other women have some of the same feeling, but it seems to me I have that feeling disproportionately strong and uh my family is critical of that, the culture is critical. Um, I'd like to be able to accept those feelings in myself. Maybe I'm making a little bit of progress along that line, but still it does seem a need to be a a strange part of me that I don't understand.”   
[C] That's right. 
[T] “And part of that attraction is sexual but I'm also attracted to their children, to the way they live, to a lot of things about them.”  
[C] And what I, what you said that strikes me the most is it’s the part of me I don't understand,  it's a part of me I don't understand. 
[T] It just is, but you can't quite uh can't quite get at the reasons for it. You have to have the reasons. 
[C]   And I don't know why I have to have the reasons,  I don't have to explain to anybody.  So it seems like I don't have to have a reason.  
[T] M-hm.  So maybe the intellectual understanding isn't as important as you thought it was. 
[C] I think the acceptance is what's most important,  my acceptance.  
[T] “If I could accept it, I wouldn't have to understand in the sense of knowing the reasons.” 
[C]  Or explain to anybody.   M-hm. 
[T] Sounds like that's what you're doing in imagination a lot, trying to explain it to somebody. 
[C] M-hm.  It seems like I'll probably never understand it.  So I can make life a lot easier for myself by not trying.  
[T] M-hm.  It may be one of those things that if you can accept it, you wouldn't need to have all the explanations.  
[C] Wonder what  what keeps me, um, feeling like I need to justify myself.  Like that's a more basic 
[T] M-hm. It's a broader statement of it. 
[C] than about a particular view, accepting myself about this and about that. 
[T] M-hm. You would in general feel “I have to justify myself with proper reasons.” 
[C] M-hm.   Well, do you do that? Do you 
[T] I suspect we all do, some.  M-hm. 
[C] So there's nobody that just  floats along on their  intuition. That’s not it either. So what I need is more balance really.  Not that I’m wrong to justify it, but that I can be more, justify it less and feel more,   and feel comfortable. 
[T] M-hm
